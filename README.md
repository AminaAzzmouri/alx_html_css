# CSS Basic Styling Project

This project demonstrates the foundational use of CSS to style HTML webpages.

## Overview

- Created a new directory `css_basic` within the `alx_html_css` repository.
- Copied `index.html` and `tweets.html` from the previous `html_basic` project to this directory.
- Added two CSS files:
  - `base.css`: Contains core CSS rules applied across the HTML pages.
  - `styles.css`: An empty stylesheet for adding custom styles and further customization.
- Linked both CSS files in the `<head>` section of each HTML file to apply the styles.

## Purpose

The goal is to enhance the appearance of the existing HTML pages by applying basic CSS styling. This serves as an introduction to separating content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), allowing for better webpage design and maintainability.

## Usage

- Open `index.html` or `tweets.html` in a web browser.
- The styles from `base.css` and `styles.css` will automatically be applied.
- You can modify `styles.css` to add your own custom styles.

## Next Steps

- Experiment with CSS selectors, properties, and layout techniques.
- Expand styles to make webpages more visually appealing and responsive.
