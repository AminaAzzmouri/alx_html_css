# Smileschool Homepage – HTML Project (ALX SE Program)

Welcome to the **Smileschool Homepage** – a fully hand-coded HTML webpage built as part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. This project demonstrates advanced HTML structuring skills based on a professional Figma design template provided by ALX.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice **semantic HTML5** to structure a comprehensive, visually rich homepage.
- Convert a **Figma design** into a pixel-perfect HTML layout.
- Reinforce best practices in accessibility, content hierarchy, and reusable markup.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

This project includes the following major sections:

- **Header**: Site logo and responsive navigation bar.
- **Hero Section**: Eye-catching intro with main CTA (Call to Action).
- **Testimonial**: A user's quote with image and attribution.
- **Tutorial Section**: Featured tutorial cards (with video thumbnails, descriptions, authors, and ratings).
- **Membership Plans**: Pricing cards for subscription options.
- **FAQ Section**: Collapsible frequently asked questions.
- **Footer**: Social media links, copyright.

All sections are built using clean, semantic HTML elements with proper indentation and structure.

## 📂 Files

|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `index.html` | Main HTML file with full page layout |
| `README.md`  | This file (project documentation)    |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. Explore the static layout and page structure.

> 💡 *Note: This version uses only HTML. No CSS or JavaScript has been added yet. Styling and interactivity will be implemented in upcoming tasks.*

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring a full webpage with **semantic HTML elements** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- Organizing content logically and cleanly to match a professional UI design.
- Planning content hierarchy for easier CSS styling and responsive design.
