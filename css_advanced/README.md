The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice using **semantic HTML5** to build structured, accessible layouts.

- **Header**: Logo and responsive navigation bar.
- **Hero Section**: Eye-catching banner with main CTA.
- **Testimonial**: Styled quote card with image and text.
- **Tutorial Section**: Grid of tutorial cards with thumbnails, authors, and ratings.
- **Membership Plans**: Pricing cards styled with Flexbox and hover effects.
- **FAQ Section**: List of frequently asked questions with visual formatting.
- **Footer**: Social media links and copyright.

All sections use clean HTML structure and modular CSS for styling and layout.

## 🎨 Styling Highlights
