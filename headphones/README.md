# 🚀 Overview

This project is a front-end implementation based on a provided Figma design. The task is to build a single, responsive, and accessible webpage using only HTML and CSS. The goal is to faithfully translate a high-fidelity design into clean, maintainable code while preserving the visual structure and behavior across screen sizes.
